# Shopping-List
Keep track of what you need to get at the grocery store by writing grocery list to a txt file
This program takes the input of a grocery and writes it to a file list.txt.
You also have the option to view and edit the list
The program will create the list file for you in the same folder you hold the program.

In the future I wan to add a function to send the list to an email of choice.
